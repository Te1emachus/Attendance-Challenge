        <p>
            We organized The Attendance Challenge in order to tackle a problem that all Corps Members (CMs) have had this year: inconsistent attendance during virtual/hybrid/in-person learning. Our goal was to increase attendance in the classrooms of CMs who participated in the challenge and stoke up a healthy bit of intra-CM competition along the way. The competition ran for three weeks.

        <h2>Methodology</h2>

        <p>
            CM classroom attendance was received through a Google Form and tabulated in a Google Sheet. Then, each CM's average attendance for the whole week was calculated. First, Second, and Third place were assigned in descending order based upon each CM's average attendance percentage. At the end of each week, a graph and a video that communicated the results was sent to each participant in the competition.
